These notes are crazed ramblings I wrote in the process of reverse engineering Super Metroid. Anything said herein should be taken with a grain of salt - if you have a question concerning the nature of the ASM in question you can just ask me directly and I'll probably have a decent answer.
These documents were not created with the intent of being published, so their value is likely rather limited.
