# Super-Duper-Metroid
Super Duper Metroid is a Super Metroid patcher and interface program, intended for use with randomizer programs. SDM is a **work in progress**, and is likely very broken in its current state. SDM requires an installation of Python 3 to work, although I haven't done any testing to determine which versions precisely work, and requires a Headerless ROM file to modify. Remember that video game piracy is a crime - only use legally obtained copies of the game Super Metroid with this program. Has been tested for NTSC.
